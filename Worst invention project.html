        <h2>Popup Ads</h2>
        <p>If you aren't living under a rock you would know about Ads or Advertisements, they are everywhere we go from
            billboards to websites. <br> normally they're not that bad, unfortunately theres Ads that are ruining user
            experience. These ads usually are flashy and pop up without warning.

        <h2>Who created it?</h2>
        <p>Meet Ethan Zuckerman, the creator of the most hated type of Advertisements. Pop-up ads have to be one of the most universally hated parts of online marketing. They’re annoying, interruptive and distracting. In fact, they’re so generally loathed that Ethan Zuckerman, has apologized publicly for creating them.<br> But why do marketers use them if people hate them so much? well its because it works! Just take a look at your emails, how many of them did you signup for without it giving you a pop up asking to sign up? a lot probably.<br> If you're still wondering what a popup looks like you can find an example<a href="https://www.bing.com/images/search?view=detailV2&ccid=h2J%2Fg8Mv&id=8C9A4696BD05339C8CB144E836CFE533BDACFE08&thid=OIP.h2J_g8Mvw5cStA6FLXN_zAHaEo&mediaurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eversparkinteractive.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F08%2Fyzzerdd.jpg&cdnurl=https%3A%2F%2Fth.bing.com%2Fth%2Fid%2FR.87627f83c32fc39712b40e852d737fcc%3Frik%3DCP6svTPlzzboRA%26pid%3DImgRaw%26r%3D0%26sres%3D1%26sresct%3D1&exph=500&expw=800&q=Annoying+Pop+Up+Ads&simid=608020674704443290&form=IRPRST&ck=59F9D12B848CFCC3716F37BE2EF45258&selectedindex=14&ajaxhist=0&ajaxserp=0&vt=0&sim=11"> here</a> </p>
    
        <h2>The worst part?</h2>
        <p>Sometimes websites wont even let you block them and you have to turn off your Adblocker just to use the website! For me thats a warning sign<br> to get the heck out of there. Not all ads are bad though and usually theyre well places as to keep a good user experience. These ads can somtimes be dangerous if you click on because they may steal your information and sell it to third party companies (not that it isn't already being sold) or they might try and phish your imformation. Malware is also a probablility but its not as common as Adware which basically infects your computer with popup ads. </p>
        <h2>Conclusion?</h2>
        <p>Pop up ads are the worst thing to be invented on the internet.</p>
